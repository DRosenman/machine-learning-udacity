## Supervised learning Tasks
Most of the content on this section was taken already from other courses, so I skipped most of it.

The term "regression" comes from the "regression to the mean", which means that in some contexts (like people's height) diferent mesurements tend to move closer to the mean. The term started being used to describe the action of finding a mathematical relationship  between several measurement points.

The main difference between K nearest neighbor and kernel regression is that in KR the points are weighted in accordance to how distant they arem and on KNN they get an equal weight.

### Parametric vs non-parametric

Parametric models have the goals of finding parameters, discard the data and then use the parameters to make predictions. KNN and KR are examples of non parametric models, where we use the data to make predictions.

For parametric (biased) advantages
- Querying is fast
- Lighter (no data needs to be stored)
- Best for mathematically explainable data sets

For non-parametric (unbiased) advantages
- No training
- Can add new data easily
- Good for chaotic data sets
