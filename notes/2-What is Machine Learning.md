## Decision Trees

A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm.

## Naive Bayes

In machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

## Linear Regression

In statistics, linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression.

## Logistic Regression

This algorithm creates a random line, and with linear descent it tries to minimize the number of errors, by shifting the line around and adding up the error distances with a logistic function.

## Support Vector Machines

Process in which we maximaze the distance from the splitting line to the closes points (supports) on each side.

## Neural Network

Nodes receive inputs and emmit an output

## Kernel Trick

Add one extra dimension to allow the points to be split by a plane.

## Lab: Classification

Wasn't familiar with jupyter notebooks, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk) made it clear.

## K-Means Clustering

Find the clusters center by setting it randomly at first, then  assigning points to clusters and move the clusters to the center multiple times. You will not always get the same result.

## Hierarchical Clustering

Finds the number of clusters by assigning them in pairs by proximity, then group the clusters untill you think the distance is too large.

## Lab: Face detection
