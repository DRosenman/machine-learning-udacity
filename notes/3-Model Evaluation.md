## Statistical Analysis

Basic statistics and numerical tools.

- Mode (range that occurs the most)
- Mean (average)
- Median (item in the middle)

Quartiles are figured out when the data points are divided equally. Q2 is the median, Q1 is the median of lower half and Q3 is median of upper half. IQR (inter quartile range) is Q3-Q1.

Outliers formula 

- < Q1 - (1.5 * IQR)
- < Q3 - (1.5 * IQR)

## Data Modeling

Data types:

- Numeric or Quantitative Data: May be continuous discreete(integers).
- Categorical Data: Represents characteristics, numbers but mathematically meaningless, may have order
- Time series: Represents time
